# Non-genetic variability in microbial populations: survival strategy or nuisance?

This repository contains code to supplement the article <a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05672.pdf"> Non-genetic variability in microbial populations: survival strategy or nuisance?</a> by Levien, Min, Kondev and Amir. 

The code is organized in python notebooks which can be run within the browser via <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/"> google colab </a> or downloaded and run locally using <a href = "https://jupyter.org/"> Jupyter </a>. The notebooks are as follows: 

| Notebook | Description  |
|---|---|
|<a href = "https://github.com/elevien/phenotypic_variability_review/blob/main/bet_hedging_kelly.ipynb"> kelly bet hedging </a> | Simulates Kelly's model of bet-hedging as described in Section 2.1 and reproduces Figure 2 (A).|
|<a href = "https://github.com/elevien/phenotypic_variability_review/blob/main/desert_annuals.ipynb"> desert annuals </a> | Plots the data ref [23] and reproduces Figure 2 (C)|
|<a href = "https://github.com/elevien/phenotypic_variability_review/blob/main/phenotypic_switching.ipynb"> phenotypic switching </a>| Simulates a simple model of phenotypic describes in Section 2.2 and reproduces Figure 3 (B).|
|<a href = "https://github.com/elevien/phenotypic_variability_review/blob/main/growth_rate_variation.ipynb"> growth rate variation </a>| Simulates different models of single-cell growth rate variation and reproduces Figure 4 (A).|
